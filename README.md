# Big Belly Baus Windows 11 Security Hardening Script

Welcome, digital adventurer, to the *Big Belly Baus* Windows 11 Security Hardening Script. This enchanted script fortifies your system with protection worthy of a kingâ€™s castle, defending against malware, ransomware, and CIA witchcraft. Weâ€™ve harnessed the powers of Microsoft 365, Office, Chrome, Adobe Reader, and Edge to make your digital realm a safer place. 

**But beware, this is not for the faint of heart.** Use this script carefully, and always ensure that you understand each command you are invoking before you proceed. If you are unsure about something, simply comment it out (by adding `::` at the start of the line) and consult your trusty IT mage.

## Preparation

Before you summon this mighty script, ensure youâ€™ve **installed** all necessary software and have confirmed that your system operates without fear of breaking. When youâ€™re ready to fortify your machine, proceed carefullyâ€”just like a knight donning their armor before battle.

### ðŸŒŸ Proceed with Caution
Backup Everything: Seriously, backup your important data before running these commands. Thereâ€™s no such thing as too much backup. Use System Restore and create your own Restore Point beforehand.
Understand What Youâ€™re Doing: This script makes permanent changes to your system settings. Be sure you know what each command is doing.
Test After Every Command: Run tests to ensure everything works after youâ€™ve enabled certain hardening measures. The last thing you want is to lock yourself out of your own kingdom.
### ðŸš¨ For the Non-Virtualization Crowd
If you donâ€™t use any virtualization software, feel free to remove the comments and activate the following commands to enable Windows Defender Application Guard and Credential Guard for a higher level of security. But if youâ€™re uncertain, donâ€™t summon these powers just yet.

### Enable Controlled Folder Access
This mystical barrier stops the malicious invadersâ€”like ransomwareâ€”from tampering with your sensitive files. Hereâ€™s how you can manually enable it:

1. Open the Start Menu.
2. Type "Controlled Folder Access."
3. Follow the instructions on screen to protect your folders.

**Tip:** If you're installing new software, add the program and/or data folders to the Controlled Folder Access list.
